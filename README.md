### A network science analysis of university social structures using ERGMs and the Facebook100 dataset to model patterns of homophily, clustering, and assortativity.

I wanted to know: could we quantify what makes a university socially distinct? So this project, The Social Genome Project, set out to decode the DNA of a campus using network science. I analyzed the Facebook100 dataset (friendship networks from 100 American universities captured in 2005) and modeled each campus as a living social organism. Every student became a node, every friendship an edge. Then I used Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze why connections form, treating attributes like dorm, major, and class year as “social genes.”

ERGMs let me test hypotheses about clustering, homophily, and assortativity through configural statistics. The modeling process, though, was incredibly demanding. Terms like GWESP, which detect triadic closure and social cohesion, are computationally heavy. I used Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation, which ran for over two days on a CUDA-enabled GPU server at Thayer Engineering. The patterns that emerged, nevertheless, were worth it. Caltech’s network showed strong homophily by residence and class year, suggesting an institutionally shaped community. Dartmouth and Cornell, by contrast, lacked clear homophily, with negative density parameters and minimal clustering by attributes like major or dorm. 

In this repository, you’ll find the main Quarto notebook (facebook100_analysis.qmd) that contains the full narrative, code, and embedded interpretation. GitHub doesn’t preview .qmd files, but the final report is available as a PDF (The_Social_Genome_Project.pdf) with all outputs and visualizations. I’ve also included my Jupyter notebook, which handled the ERGM computation pipeline.
